# Software Developer - Data Platform

## About us

Shopify is a leading cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform that empowers entrepreneurs all around the world to build and grow their businesses. We are looking for accomplished full-stack developers to join our Data Platform Engineering team. In our world, we care deeply about the availability, performance, and stability of the data processing and storage engines that power Shopifyâ€™s many data products.  This isnâ€™t a traditional Data Engineering role, you would not be building individual pipelines for analytics users, and is closer in scope to software engineering roles tied to web-scale platform development.    

We support the organization in making better decisions. We deploy and maintain a variety of scalable technologies for extracting and transforming a multitude of different sources of data, including Shopifyâ€™s operational databases. We have a petabyte scale YARN cluster running Apache Spark for transformation, and a variety of analytics technologies on top of it. 

We need passionate software and operations developers who get excited about how data can empower the 1M+ merchants that use Shopify today. Apply now to join one of our many teams hiring: Data Distribution, Data Acquisition, Data Modelling, Storage and Query Technologies, and Machine Learning Platform.

## Youâ€™ll need to have:
- Extensive software development experience - you are proficient with things like software design patterns, code review, a variety of languages and paradigms, TDD, etc.
- Extensive database experience - you are familiar with things like SQL query authoring, table design patterns for OLAP and OLTP, a variety of databases, and the tradeoffs between them
- Experience with building and maintaining distributed systems and knowledge of the associated patterns, concerns, and tradeoffs
- Demonstrated ability to work in multiple languages and platforms


## Itâ€™d be nice if you had:
- Python, Spark, Scala, Go, or Java
- Cloud Computing (Google Cloud, AWS, Azure)
- Optimized storage strategies such as columnar file formats, partitioning, bucketing, and bloom filters


## Location

Our Data Platform Engineering roles are curently based in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦(Ottawa, Toronto and Waterloo) and does require relocation. We know this may not be something you have yet considered. The stability & clear future prospects that Canada can offer may just be exactly what youâ€™ve been looking for!

We happily offer immigration assistance and relocation support for successful hires and their families. There is a clear path to Canadian permanent residency when you work with us and the visa in many cases also allows for a work permit for spouses. Weâ€™ve moved hundreds of amazing people and their loved ones to Canada from around the world and weâ€™re experts in making the process as simple and pain-free for you as possible. Donâ€™t just take my word for it, hear from some of the team [here!](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6605116004030914560/).
