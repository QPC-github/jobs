Our 1,000,000 merchants process over $72 billion in gross merchant volume through our platform, and depend on us to deliver insights that enable them to grow their business. The Data Science & Engineering team acts as the impact multiplier for Shopifyâ€™s product teams, putting over 11 petabytes of data to work to make our merchants more successful.  From delivering merchandising insights, to optimizing shipping and processing rates, to reducing credit card fraud, to ad campaign recommendations - our Data Scientists deliver solutions from pipeline to platform via an array of open source tools.
